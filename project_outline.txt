Statement of Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to create a simple multiplayer game that
uses Node.js with Sockets.io to create the connection between clients.
Sockets.io will allow us to easily use the websockets to make this interaction
possible. The game will consist of a simple top-down shooter made using the
canvas element.

Version 1 features:
User will have login functionality which will be checked against a database for verification. Also the ability to enter a single game by multiple users in different clients.
